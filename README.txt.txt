Overview:
The goal of the project is to interconnect two devices using Wi-Fi direct and allow the users of the devices to play the classic hangman game; and a game session starts. The players take turns in guessing words. The player who initiates the connection goes first and gets to specify a word, which the second player has to guess, and a hint (displayed to player 2). The second player tries to guess the letters of the word and player 1 decides whether the letter is in the word or not. With every wrong guess, a part the man is hanged. The game ends if the second player guessed the word or if the hangman diagram is completed. The total score is displayed at the end of a game session. Any player can end the game session at any time
